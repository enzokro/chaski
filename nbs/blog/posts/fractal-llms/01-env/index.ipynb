    "# Appendix 1: Silent Failures in ML Models\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs, and Machine Learning models more generally, often fail in different ways than other software. For instance, classic bugs in regular software are things like: type mismatches, syntax errors, compilation errors, etc. In other words, failures that stem from a clearly *wrong* operation (aka a bug) that snuck into the code. We wanted the computer to do `X`, but we told it by accident to do `Y` instead.\n",

    "In contrast, ML models often have \"silent\" failures. There is no syntax or compilation error - the program still runs and completes fine. But, there is *something* wrong in the code: adding where we should have subtracted, grabbing the wrong element from a list, or using the wrong mathematical function. There is no type checker or compiler that would (or even could, for now) catch these errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The fixes for these silent failures are clear:  \n",
    "- Carefully inspecting the code.  \n",
    "- Monitoring and validating the model outputs.  \n",

    "There is another, unfortunate kind of silent failure: version mismatches. Version mismatches happen when we use a different version of a specific programming library from the version that the model was originally created with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the software libraries we rely on are updated frequently, both subtle and major changes in their internals can affect a model's output. These failures are unfortunately immune to our careful, logical checks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding these silent failures is the main reason for being consistent and disciplined with our model's programming environment. A good environment setup keeps us focused on the important, conceptual parts of our pipeline instead of getting bogged down managing software versions. "
