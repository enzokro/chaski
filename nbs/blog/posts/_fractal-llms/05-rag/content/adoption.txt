Who’s using Diátaxis? ¶ At Gatsby we recently reorganized our open-source documentation, and the Diátaxis framework was our go-to resource throughout the project.

By restructuring our documentation around the Diátaxis framework, we made it easier for users to discover the resources that they need when they need them. —Megan Sullivan ( @meganesulli ) Not listed here?
